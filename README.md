# Rack-Man

### Statement
We have decided to create our own version of the classic game Pacman using Racket, and its libraries. The game will feature the classic gameplay of the original, with implemented web based high score tracking. We hope to learn about project organization, as well as experience working on a team based assignment. In addition, we hope to gain experience with utilizing libraries and external resources.

### Analysis

#Recursion and Maps & Filters

We plan on using recursion to get the game universe to be generated. Since the game is constantly being updated this will be the perfect place to use a recursive function. We also plan on using recursion to process user inputs like up, down, left, right.

#Object-Orientation

We plan on using an object orientated approach in this project. Since we’re creating a game, we’ll be using making the Rack-Man an object as well as the ghosts.

#State-Modification

We plan on using some sort of state-modification to track when the Rack-Man eats one of the power pellets to have the ghosts turn into a blue ghost which can be eaten.

### External Technologies
You are encouraged to develop a project that connects to external systems. For example, this includes systems that:

- retrieve information or publish data to the web
- generate or process sound
- control robots or other physical systems
- interact with databases

If your project will do anything in this category (not only the things listed above!), include this section and discuss.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload from a website? Access in a database? Create in a simulation you will build? ...)

How will you convert your data into a form usable for your project?  

If you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it before writing the proposal. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materials, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day? 

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day?  

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
What additionally will be completed before the public presentation?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
